              <h2><span class="Sub_headline"> when pitaya was discoverd?</span> </h2>
              Pitaya (Family Cactaceae, Hylocereus undatus Haw.)
              Pitaya or the dragon fruit is believed to be an origin of Mexico and Central and South America. Today, this fruit is widely cultivated and has gained popularity in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Bangladesh, and Australia. Typical to a cactus plant, pitaya is an evergreen annual plant with cladode (as stem). Fruits are categorized with the presence of unique bracts on the thin skin of bright red (pink to purple)-colored fruits. Flowers and fruits of the plant are edible. Depending on the cultivar, the edible pulp portion can be either red (pink) (H. polyrhizus), white (H. undatus), or yellow (H. megalanthus) with small tiny black edible seeds. Overall, average weight of a fruit is approximately 300–350 g, and a single plant is estimated to produce up to six cycles of fruits annually.
              
              Pitaya fruit is preferred by consumers owing to their unique taste, shape, and flesh color. Though pitaya is preferred to be eaten directly, intake as fresh juice is more popular in the growing regions. Pitaya-based products like jams and candy are commercially available in Malaysia and Indonesia. Wine preparation from red pitaya is also reported in Guangxi province of China. Pitaya fruit (both skin and flesh portions) is reported to contain water-soluble betacyanins, which are responsible for the intense red (dark pink/purple) color and its antioxidant activities. In addition, lycopene, vitamin E, and beta-carotene are reported in the pulp portion.
              
              Fruits are high in total polyphenols, tannins, betalains, nonbetalainic compounds, and antioxidant compounds. Oligosaccharides from pitaya fruit are linked with prebiotic properties. Pitaya peel contains high amount of pectin and insoluble to soluble fiber. In addition, powder prepared from the fruit has potential to be used as natural food colorant. Significant amount of betacyanin pigment is reported from peel. Inhibition in the growth of melanoma cells is also reported from peel extracts of red pitaya. Intake of pitaya fruit is also linked with the reduction of dyslipidemia and promotion of wound healing capacity in diabetic rats. Seeds encompass essential fatty acids dominated by linoleic and linolenic acids.

                <h2><span class="Sub_headline">Smoothie you can make!</span></h2>
                A perfect Dragon Fruit Smoothie, made with a creamy blend of dragon fruit, mango, and banana. Keep this dragon fruit smoothie recipe vegan by using a non dairy milk and subbing a plant based protein. Dragon fruit has a mild taste, so the tropical flavor is played up with a squeeze of fresh lime.
                To make preparing smoothies easy, keep frozen fruit stocked in the freezer. I typically have a combination of frozen bananas, berries, and grapefruit ready to throw into smoothies. Lately, I have been adding dragon fruit to the mix because the vibrant color makes my day!

Once the fruit is frozen, toss it in the blender with a non dairy milk, like almond or coconut, a squeeze of lime, and a scoop of protein powder. I like this whey protein isolate because it’s pure protein – no carbs or artificial sweeteners – it tastes great, and adds the BEST creamy and light texture to smoothies.
Dragon fruit has a mild sweet taste. Some people describe the flavor as similar to kiwi, although it doesn’t have the strong tart flavor of a kiwi.

If a dragon fruit isn’t ripe, it has almost no flavor. I’ve also found that organic dragon fruits, and dragon fruits from Thailand, have the sweetest flavors.

If you live far away from where dragon fruit grows, you might want to avoid the $10 price tag of a fresh fruit. While exotic and beautiful, most often they have no flavor at all. If you live in North America, and want to enjoy this fruit, try Pitaya Plus smoothie packs, available at health food stores such as Whole Foods.
Dragon fruit has a lightly sweet taste and benefits from blending up with sweeter fruits. Bananas, mango, strawberries, blueberries and pineapple all add great flavor to dragon fruit smoothies. Dragon fruit smoothies work well with non dairy milks, like almond milk, coconut milk and oat milk. Boost the staying powder of your smoothie by adding protein powder, chia seeds, hemp seeds, or greens, like spinach and kale.
1 cup dragon fruit cubed and frozen
1 cup mango cubed and frozen
2 bananas cut into quarters and frozen
3/4 cup almond milk or sub coconut
2 tablespoons lime juice
1/2 scoop whey protein powder* option, can sub plant based protein powder
2-4 ice cubes depending on how thick an icy you'd like it!

Pitaya, commonly known as dragon fruit, is not just a visually stunning tropical fruit; it also boasts a myriad of health benefits that make it a delightful addition to your diet. This exotic fruit, with its vibrant pink or yellow skin and speckled flesh, is not only a feast for the eyes but also a nutritional powerhouse.

One of the key advantages of pitaya is its rich antioxidant content. Antioxidants play a crucial role in neutralizing harmful free radicals in the body, which helps prevent cell damage and inflammation. The high levels of vitamin C in pitaya contribute significantly to its antioxidant properties, promoting a robust immune system and supporting overall health.

Additionally, pitaya is an excellent source of dietary fiber, which aids digestion and promotes a healthy gut. The fiber content in dragon fruit can help regulate bowel movements, prevent constipation, and contribute to a feeling of fullness, making it a valuable asset for those looking to maintain a healthy weight.

For individuals seeking to manage their blood sugar levels, pitaya can be a valuable ally. Despite its naturally sweet taste, dragon fruit has a low glycemic index, meaning it causes a slower rise in blood sugar levels. This makes it a suitable option for individuals with diabetes or those aiming to stabilize their blood sugar.

Furthermore, pitaya contains essential vitamins and minerals such as vitamin B, iron, and phosphorus, contributing to improved energy levels and bone health. The fruit's magnesium content supports muscle function and aids in the maintenance of a healthy heartbeat.

Pitaya's hydration benefits should not be overlooked. With a water content of over 90%, dragon fruit helps keep the body well-hydrated, promoting skin health and overall vitality. Staying hydrated is essential for various bodily functions, and pitaya provides a tasty and refreshing way to meet hydration needs.

Incorporating pitaya into your diet is easy, as it can be enjoyed fresh, added to smoothies, or included in fruit salads. Whether you're looking to boost your immune system, support digestion, or simply savor a delicious and nutritious fruit, pitaya stands out as a fantastic choice with a multitude of health benefits.
